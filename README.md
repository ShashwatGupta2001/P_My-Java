Getting my hands dirty on Java, Jars, Applets and AWTs

The project Map:
1. Calculator AWT - Full : A complete caluculator Aplication which can be run both as an executable JAR and as an applet
2. Calculator AWT : A Calculator using AWT
3. Email - AWT : Email Client using Java
4. Table Generator : Mathematical Table generator in the form of an executable JAR
5. Bouncing Balls.jar (executable Jar)
6. Clock.jar (executable Jar)
7. Color Boxes.jar (executable Jar)
8. Desk Ball.jar (executable Jar)
9. Traffic Light.jar (executable Jar)
10. VirCreator.jar (executable Jar)


Out of interest, I developed these using different IDEs:
1. BlueJ
2. JCreator
3. Ecllipse
